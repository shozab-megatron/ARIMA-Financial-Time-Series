# ARIMA Model for Financial Time Series Forecasting

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate an ARIMA model using Python to forecast stock closing prices.

## Tasks Performed:
- Pulled financial data from Google Cloud Storage into Pandas
- Cleaned and prepared the data
- Applied Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
- Built and tuned ARIMA model using `statsmodels`
- Visualized predictions vs actual prices

## Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, statsmodels, JupyterLab, GCP

## Sample Output:
- [x] Forecast plot with confidence intervals
- [x] ACF/PACF plots
- [x] Stationarity test results
